# Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of basic sorting algorithms in Python.

## 1. Bubble Sort
Time Complexity:
- Best: O(n)
- Average: O(n²)
- Worst: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1)

## 2. Selection Sort
Time Complexity:
- Best: O(n²)
- Average: O(n²)
- Worst: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1)
